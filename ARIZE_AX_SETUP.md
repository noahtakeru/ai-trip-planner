# Arize AX Observability Setup Guide

## Overview
Your AI Trip Planner is now enhanced with comprehensive Arize AX observability to trace and monitor your multi-agent system. You can visualize the entire agent workflow, tool usage, and performance metrics in the Arize dashboard.

## What's Instrumented

### ✅ Enhanced Tracing Features
- **Session Tracking**: Each trip request gets a unique session ID
- **Multi-Agent Spans**: Individual spans for Research, Budget, Local, and Itinerary agents
- **Tool Call Tracing**: All 12 tools are tracked with arguments and results
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, token usage, and output lengths
- **Error Handling**: Failed requests are logged with stack traces
- **Parallel Execution Visibility**: See how Research, Budget, and Local agents run concurrently

### 🔍 Custom Spans & Attributes
- **`trip_planning_workflow`**: Main request span with trip details
- **`research_agent`**: Weather, visa, and destination research
- **`budget_agent`**: Cost analysis and pricing
- **`local_agent`**: Cultural insights and hidden gems
- **`itinerary_agent`**: Final synthesis of all agent outputs
- **`langgraph_execution`**: LangGraph orchestration span

### 📊 Tracked Metrics
- Request parameters (destination, duration, budget, interests)
- Tool call counts per agent
- Output lengths and completion status
- Agent execution timing
- Session correlation across multi-turn interactions

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your Arize AX Credentials
1. Sign up at [arize.com](https://arize.com)
2. Create a new project called "ai-trip-planner"
3. Get your `ARIZE_SPACE_ID` and `ARIZE_API_KEY` from the dashboard

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Arize AX Observability (for agent tracing)
ARIZE_SPACE_ID=your_space_id_here
ARIZE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Test the Setup
Start your backend and look for this success message:
```
✅ Arize AX tracing initialized successfully
```

If you see warnings:
```
⚠️  Arize credentials not found. Set ARIZE_SPACE_ID and ARIZE_API_KEY environment variables.
```

### 4. Generate Some Traces
Make a few trip planning requests:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/plan-trip \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "destination": "Tokyo, Japan",
    "duration": "5 days", 
    "budget": "moderate",
    "interests": "food, temples, tech"
  }'
```

### 5. View in Arize Dashboard
1. Go to [app.arize.com](https://app.arize.com)
2. Navigate to your "ai-trip-planner" project
3. View traces, spans, and performance metrics

## What You'll See in Arize

### 🎯 Agent Workflow Visualization
```

├── langgraph_execution
    ├── research_agent (parallel)
    │   ├── essential_info tool
    │   ├── weather_brief tool
    │   └── visa_brief tool
    ├── budget_agent (parallel)
    │   ├── budget_basics tool

    │   └── local_customs tool
    └── itinerary_agent (synthesis)
```

### 📈 Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Request Volume**: Trips planned per hour/day
- **Latency**: End-to-end response times
- **Tool Usage**: Which tools are called most frequently
- **Agent Performance**: Which agents take longest to execute
- **Error Rates**: Failed requests and causes
- **Parallel Efficiency**: Time savings from concurrent execution

### 🔧 Performance Optimization
Use Arize insights to:
- Identify slow tools or agents
- Optimize prompt templates
- Monitor token usage and costs
- Debug failed requests
- A/B test different agent configurations

## Troubleshooting

### No Traces Appearing
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify internet connectivity to Arize
3. Look for error messages in console logs
4. Ensure you're making requests to the instrumented endpoints

### Missing Tool Traces  
- Tool calls are automatically captured by LangChain instrumentation
- Custom spans show tool counts and names
- Check individual agent spans for tool call details

### Performance Impact
- Tracing adds ~10-50ms overhead per request
- All tracing is asynchronous and won't block responses
- Set `ARIZE_SPACE_ID=""` to disable tracing if needed

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Evaluation Metrics
Add your own evaluation spans:
```python
if tracer:
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("itinerary_evaluation") as eval_span:
        # Your evaluation logic here
        eval_span.set_attributes({
            "evaluation.score": score,
            "evaluation.criteria": "completeness"
        })
```

### Session Grouping
For multi-turn conversations, use the same session ID:
```python
session_id = req.headers.get("X-Session-ID", str(uuid.uuid4()))
with using_session(session_id=session_id):
    # Your agent workflow
```

## What's Next?

With Arize AX set up, you can:
1. **Monitor Production**: Track real user requests and performance
2. **Debug Issues**: Drill down into failed requests and slow responses
3. **Optimize Performance**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize hot paths
4. **Evaluate Quality**: Add custom metrics for itinerary quality
5. **A/B Testing**: Compare different agent configurations
6. **Scale Insights**: Monitor performance as you add more agents or tools

🚀 **Your multi-agent trip planner is now fully observable!**
